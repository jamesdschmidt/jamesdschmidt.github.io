# About

![25049668](images/25049668.jpeg) I'm James. I'm a programmer with experience in pharma, healthcare, Customer Experience (CX), ecommerce, and Workplace Experience (WX). I've developed client-server systems, embedded, mobile apps, and hosted web solutions. I'm focused on microservice architectures and reactive microservices. I live in the greater Salt Lake City area close to tall mountains where I hike and mountain bike.

<img src="/assets/images/site-logo.jpeg" alt="Profile Picture" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px" /> I live in the Salt Lake City, Utah area where I work as a Senior Software Engineer. I have over 20 year experience developing software and am currently focused on microservice architectures with Java. In my spare time, I play bass guitar, hike, and mountain bike.

# About

I'm James. I'm a programmer with experience in pharma, healthcare, Customer Experience (CX), ecommerce, and now Workplace Experience (WX). I've developed client-server systems, embedded, mobile apps, and hosted web solutions. Today I'm focused on microservices in Java, Python, and Go. I live and in the greater Salt Lake City area close to tall mountains where I love to hike and mountain bike.

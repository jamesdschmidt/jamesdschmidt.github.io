title: What I Use

## Hardware

For work I use a 2021 16" **MacBook Pro** (M1 Max CPU, 32 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD) with a wireless Apple keyboard and mouse. The updated keyboard on the MacBook is so much better. I didn't care for the Touch Bar and am glad it is gone. I dock the MacBook to my **Apple 27" Thunderbolt Display**. Been thinking about getting a mechanical keyboard like the [Keychron K2](https://www.keychron.com/collections/keyboard/products/keychron-k2-wireless-mechanical-keyboard) but can't decide on the switch type.

I have 2 Gbps **Google Fiber** internet access at home. I've noticed that many web servers are throttled at 100 Mbps.

Finally upgraded to a **Google Pixel 6a** from an iPhone 6s Plus. I miss the headphones jack and am disappointed that smart phones moved away from it.

## Software

For Java work I use the JetBrains **Intellij** integrated development environment (IDE). I've used several and this is my favorite. For dynamic programming languages and general text editing I use **TextMate**. For image and photo editing I use **Pixelmator**.

An audiophile friend of mine tuned me in to **Spotify** for music. I haven't looked back.

title: What I Use

## Hardware

For work I use a 2021 16" **MacBook Pro** (M1 Max CPU, 32 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD) with a wireless Apple keyboard and mouse. The updated keyboard on the MacBook is so much better. I didn't care for the Touch Bar and am glad it is gone. I dock the MacBook to my **Apple 27" Thunderbolt Display** on a **Rain mStand**. I've been thinking about getting a mechanical keyboard like the [Keychron K2](https://www.keychron.com/collections/keyboard/products/keychron-k2-wireless-mechanical-keyboard) but can't decide on the switch type.

I have 1 Gbps internet access at home. I notice that many web servers are throttled at around 100 Mbps.

I'm a hold out with my **iPhone 6s Plus** (128 GB). I really do like the headphones jack. A few years ago I had the battery replaced but Apple failed to assemble the camera and flash properly when I got it back. They replaced my phone. I don't get that kind of customer service anywhere else.

## Software

For Java work I use the JetBrains **Intellij** integrated development environment (IDE). I've used several and this is my favorite. For dynamic programming languages and general text editing I use **TextMate**. For image and photo editing I use **Pixelmator**.

An audiophile friend of mine tuned me into to **Spotify** for music. I haven't looked back.

title: What I Use

## Hardware

At home I use a 2013 13" **MacBook Air** (8 GB RAM, 128 GB SSD). I got this for it's all day battery and it's portability. I dock the MacBook Air to an **Apple 27" Thunderbolt Display** on a **Rain mStand**. When docked I use the **Apple compact wired keyboard** and the **Razer Deathadder Elite** mouse. I've been thinking about getting a mechanical keyboard like the [Keychron K2](https://www.keychron.com/collections/keyboard/products/keychron-k2-wireless-mechanical-keyboard) but can't decide on the switch type.

I have 1 Gbps internet access at home. I notice that many web servers are throttled at around 100 Mbps.

For work I use a 2017 15" **MacBook Pro** (16 GB RAM, 250 GB SSD). I dock it to my home setup when working from home.

I'm a hold out with my **iPhone 6s Plus** (128 GB). I really do like the headphones jack. A few years ago I had the battery replaced but Apple failed to assemble the flash and camera properly when I got it back. They replaced my phone. I don't see that kind of customer service elsewhere.

## Software

For Java work I use the JetBrains **Intellij** integrated development environment (IDE). I've used several and this is my favorite. For dynamic programming languages and general text editing I use **TextMate**. For image and photo editing I use **Pixelmator**.

An audiophile friend of mine turned me to **Spotify** for music. I haven't looked back.

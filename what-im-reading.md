### *Effective Java, Third Edition* by Joshua Bloch
I've heard it said in a local Java user group meeting that this book should be read yearly. Looks like this book is a permanent resident on my list.

### *The DevOps Handbook* by Gene Kim, et al.
I've listened to the Audible recording of this at least twice. I have since purchased the book and am reading through it. I have also listened to the audiobook companion novel *The Phoenix Project*. It is a must.

### *Clean Code* by Robert C. Martin
Uncle Bob is a legend and this is a must read.

### *The Wishsong of Shannara* by Terry Brooks
The author has improved his pacing and writing style. Fortunately we get less, painstaking detail of every blade of grass on the journeys of the characters.

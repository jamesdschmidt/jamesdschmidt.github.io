### *Effective Java, Third Edition* by Joshua Bloch
I've heard it said in a recent local Java user group meeting that this book should be read yearly. Looks like this book is a permanent resident on my list.

### *The DevOps Handbook* by Gene Kim, et al.
I've listened to the Audible recording of this at least twice on my commute last year. I have since purchased the book and am reading through it. I have also listened to the audiobook companion novel *The Phoenix Project*. It is a must.

### *Clean Code* by Robert C. Martin
Uncle Bob is a legend and this is a must read.

### *Minecraft | The Mountain* by Max Brooks
The picks where he left off with the main character in the prior book *Minecraft | The Island*.

## What I've Recently Read

### *Minecraft | The Island* by Max Brooks
Read this to my son for bedtime. Didn't care for the first person voice. Definitely written for a younger audience.

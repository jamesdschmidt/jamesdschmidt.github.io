title: What I'm Reading

## *Effective Java, Third Edition* by Joshua Bloch
I've heard it said in a recent local Java user group meeting that this book should be read yearly. Looks like this book is a permanent resident on my list.

## *The DevOps Handbook* by Gene Kim, et al.
I've listened to the Audible recording of this at least twice on my commute this last year. I have since purchased the book and am reading through it. I have also listened to the audiobook companion novel *The Phoenix Project*. It is a must.

## *Clean Code* by Robert C. Martin
I recently started a book club at work and we are covering this title.

## *Spring in Action, Sixth Edition* by Craig Walls
Craig is back at it again writing a new edition of his infamous title. Only the first few chapters are available from the publisher right now. It is scheduled for release in the Spring of 2021.

## *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire* by J. K. Rolling
I'm reading the Harry Potter series for fun to my son nightly.

This article will describe getting path parameters in a Spring Boot HTTP microservice.

consider writing a todo-based microservice app (users, lists, tasks)
list.title
task.title

**simple case**
Reading a path parameter is done with the @PathVariable annotation from Spring. I wish they named the annotation as @PathParam instead.

**variation on parameter name and argument name**

**invalid data type (/products/12fa) 400 or 404**

**can it be optional?**

**default values?**

**embedded resources (/products/{productId}/reviews/{reviewId})**
I don't recommend going more than two resources deep in an URL so I won't show an example for that case.
